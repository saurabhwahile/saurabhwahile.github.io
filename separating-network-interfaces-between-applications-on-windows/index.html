            <p>So a little context on my problem, I have 2 interfaces, one is a ethernet connected to my router which then connects to a adsl modem, the second one is a 4g dongle which I got 2 months earlier. I decided I could team them up and run all of my traffic over them. Obviously i was aware of the latency and the speed difference between the networks, however, somehow I believed, since windows loves to automate stuff, the speed and latency would be balanced better than in a round robin fashion. </p>

<p>Perhaps I was a bit too over optimistic. So when I started noticing there was a problem, I knew something had to be done. There were 2 ways this could have been accomplished: <br />
1. Try for a better load balancing (a software load balancer or tweaking the interface metrics) <br />
2. Separate the programs using the interfaces(use ForceBindIP)</p>

<p>Now, first I set the interface metric at lower(5) for my wired network and higher(15) for the 4g network. Realizing it did not made much of a difference I decided to set an even higher value for the 4g network(3000). At this point I realized that this was too difficult to optimize as even a single starting packet over the 4g device could stall the whole connection. </p>

<p>This is when I decided to separate the applications itself. Run chrome over the ethernet and my downloads over the 4g network. Now to accomplish this I sought help from ForceBindIP  </p>

<pre><code>ForceBindIP64.exe -i 192.168.1.5 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"  
</code></pre>

<p>Testing this I saw that chrome was still trying to use both the interfaces. However other applications seem to be working fine and using the correct interface. The problem with chrome was due to the fact that chrome spawns multiple child processes which stay independent of the interface set in ForceBindIP. </p>

<p>So the final solution to the problem was: <br />
1. Force bind applications that use the 4g network <br />
2. Delete the route to the 4g network</p>

<pre><code>route delete &lt;interface ip&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>So this solution worked for my specific use case given: <br />
1. A slower high latency network paired with a high speed low latency network <br />
2. Having low priority applications that can be used over the slow n/w</p>
